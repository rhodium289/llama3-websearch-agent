       "Henry Ford (July 30, 1863 - April 7, 1947) was an American industrialist and business magnate. He was born on a family farm near Dearborn, Michigan, and attended a one-room school for eight years.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ford worked his way up from a machinist's apprentice at age 15 to become the chief engineer at the Edison Company. In 1911, he was awarded a patent for the transmission mechanism used in the Model T and other automobiles.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the founder of the Ford Motor Company, Ford is credited with making automobiles affordable for middle-class Americans through the system known as Fordism. He launched the company on June 16, 1903, after selling his Quadricycle for $200 and repurchasing it in 1904 for $65.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ford is also famous for inventing the assembly line in the early 20th century, which revolutionized the automotive industry by mass-producing vehicles that were affordable to the masses. He founded the Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation and Greenfield Village in Michigan in 1929 to collect objects that were being lost to a changing society.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some notable facts about Henry Ford include:\n",
       "\n",
       "* He was one of eight children born to William and Mary Ford.\n",
       "* Abraham Lincoln was president of the 24 states of the Union, while Jefferson Davis was president of the 11 states of the Confederacy during his lifetime.\n",
       "* The Henry Ford Museum complex contains the presidential limousine of John F. Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln's chair from Ford's Theatre, Thomas Edison's laboratory, and the Wright Brothers' bicycle.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, Henry Ford was a pioneer in the automotive industry who left a lasting legacy through his inventions, innovations, and entrepreneurial spirit."
